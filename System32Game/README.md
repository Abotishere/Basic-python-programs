**1. Project Title**

Simple Console Number Guessing Game

**2. Overview**

This is a basic Python script that implements a classic number guessing game. The program generates a random integer between 1 and 100, prompts the user for a guess, and then checks if the guess is correct.

**3. How It Works**

**Initialization:** The script uses the random module to select a secret number.

**User Input:** It uses the input() function to prompt the user to enter their guess.

**Comparison:** An if/else structure compares the user's input to the secret number.

**Outcome:** The program prints a success message upon a correct guess or a friendly failure message (and reveals the correct number) upon an incorrect guess.

**4. Execution Requirements**

**Language:** Python 3.x

**Dependencies:** Standard Python libraries (random). No external installations are required.

**5. How to Run**

Save the Python code (the clean, non-malicious version) to a file (e.g., guess_game.py).

Open your command-line interface (CLI) or terminal.

Execute the file using the Python interpreter:

Bash

python guess_game.py
